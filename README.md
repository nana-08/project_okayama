Internship in Okayama University, Japan

## GOAL of the overall project: 
Develop and implement a distributed algorithm in Python for solving a system of linear equations Bx = C.

## GOALS step by step
# GOAL 1
Read [Takahashi and Kawashima's paper](ieeecsl2018_takahashi_kawashima.pdf) and understand what is done in the Projected Consensus Algorithm.

# GOAL 2
Implement a simplified version of their algorithm using Python on a single computer.
