# project_okayama
Internship in Okayama University, Japan
Tutor: Norikazu Takahashi

## GOAL of the overall project: 
Develop and implement a distributed algorithm in Python for solving a system of linear equations Bx = C.

## GOALS step by step
- [x] Read [Takahashi and Kawashima's paper](ieeecsl2018_takahashi_kawashima.pdf) and understand what is done in the Projected Consensus Algorithm.

- [ ] Implement a simplified version of their algorithm using Python on a single computer.

- [ ] Implement the program on 10 Raspberry Pi computers communicating witn each other (ex, 10 computers work as web servers and communication is done using http protocols)
